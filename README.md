# Pedinophyceae-Biogeography
A biogeography study of Pedinophyceae using the EukBank metabarcoding database

In the coding project I will start working on extracting metadata (e.g. sampling site, sampling depth (ocean), sampling fraction) for my sequences of interest that belong to the a family of algae called Pedinophyceae. Extracting the data will not be very straight forward as each sequence can stem from different sampling efforst, meaning there are several metadatsets connected to each sequence. The metadat are also partially stored in different files. First I want to start collecting the data in a way that I can do data analysis on them later on. The data analysis will include some plotting (of geographical regions) as well as statistics.
